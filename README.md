# Discord-bot
After you created your bot in your Discord account, create an "auth.json" file with the bot's ID ant token. The file should be in the same directory than "app.js" file.

The correct syntax is
> { \n
> 	"id": "the_bot's_id", \n
> 	"token": "the bot's token" \n
> }

The program is provided "as is". Therefore I cannot be held responsible for any software and/or hardware malfunction, deterioration, corruption, nor any combination of all above.
Thus, I cannot be held responsible is you lose access to Discord if you used your own ID/Token, this is a violation of Discord's ToS. This is why you shall use **only** a bot account to run this code.
