# Discord-bot
After you created your bot in your Discord account, create an `auth.json` file with the bot's ID ant token. The file should be in the same directory than "app.js" file.

The correct syntax is
```javascript
{
	"id": "the_bot's_id",
	"token": "the_bot's_token"
}
```

Once you have created the `auth.json` file, launch a console and enter `npm install`. This will install the needed packages. Then, type `node .\app.js` on Windows or `node ./app.js` on Linux and macOS.

**The program is provided "as is". Therefore I cannot be held responsible for any software and/or hardware malfunction, deterioration, corruption, nor any combination of all above.**

**Thus, I cannot be held responsible is you lose access to Discord if you used your own ID/Token, this is a violation of Discord's ToS. This is why you shall use ONLY a bot account to run this code.**
